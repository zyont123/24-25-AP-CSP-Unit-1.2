#   a123_TR_apple_typing_3.py
#   Run code in VS Code to be able to access the images.
#   Example soulution:
#      Code connects to the image of an apple.
#      The apple is located on the image of a tree.
#      The apple does not draw a line as it falls.
#      When A is pressed, the letter A appears on the apple.
#      The apple falls to the ground when the A key is pressed.
#      The apple and letter dissapear after the apple hits the ground.

#TODO define a function per letter that you will use in your program. Each function should check

#TODO use the onkeypress method of wn to correlate the functions you defined above with each

# onkeypress requires that you name one function that must take
